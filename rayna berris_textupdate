Electrical circuit elements that resist the flow of electricity and electric charge
Passive two terminal element (does not generate its own energy)
Resistance = R and is measured in Ohms  Ω 
    1  Ω = 1V/1A
Resistance is the subset of a broad phenomenon known as impedence (Z), which is an element's total opposition to a current when a potential is applied.

Resistivity: based on 3 parameters
        1) ρ --> materials abiliity to resist flow ( Ω m)
        2) l --> length of the element (m)
        3) A --> cross sectional area of element (m^2)
        
   *  R = ρ*(l/A) *

Resistivity and Materials
Materials that exhibit a high resistivity are things that are classified as conductors. Conductors are commonly associated 
with metals such as silver. In contrast, materials that exhibit a low resistivity are called insulators. Some common examples of 
insulators would be polymers such as plastics, ceramics and glass. 


Here is a link to a video that further explains the concepts of resistivity and resistance.
